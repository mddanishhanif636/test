            <p><strong>Free Cash Flow to Firm Model:</strong>
FCFF valuation is a method of estimating the intrinsic value of an asset based on the present value of its expected cash flows. To use DCF, an analyst needs to estimate the asset's life, cash flows, and the discount rate. DCF valuation is less influenced by market moods and perceptions, and it forces investors to think about the underlying characteristics of the firm. However, DCF valuation requires more explicit inputs and information than other methods, and the inputs can be noisy and manipulated. It works best for assets that generate cash flows, and for investors who have a long-term horizon, are capable of providing a catalyst for price to move to value, and are not swayed by market movements.

<br><br><strong>Excess Return Model:</strong>
Excess Return Models focus on the present value of expected excess returns that a firm is expected to generate in the future, in addition to the capital invested currently in the firm. Although it is challenging to calculate the total invested capital in Financial Service firms, this model can still be applied to value equity in such firms by focusing solely on equity. The value of equity in a financial service firm can be determined by adding the equity capital invested currently to the present value of expected excess returns to equity investors from current and future investments. This model's emphasis on excess returns is noteworthy as it differentiates between firms that earn just the fair-market rate of return on their equity investments and those that earn a below-market return, which would result in their equity market value dipping below the equity capital currently invested. Additionally, this model considers expected future investments, making it necessary for the analyst using the model to forecast both where the financial service firm will direct its future investments and the expected returns on those investments.

<br><br><strong>Relative Valuation:</strong>
Relative valuation is an approach that estimates the value of an asset by comparing it to the prices of similar or comparable assets in the market. This valuation method requires an identical or similar asset, a standardized measure of value, and variables to control for differences. Relative valuation is advantageous as it reflects market perceptions and moods, and is tailored to the needs of portfolio managers who are judged based on how they perform on a relative basis. However, relative valuation assumes that markets are correct in the aggregate, and may require implicit assumptions about other variables. Relative valuation works best when there are a large number of comparable assets priced in a market and a common variable can be used to standardize the price. This approach is suitable for investors with short time horizons, who are judged based on a relative benchmark and can take actions to exploit relative mispricing.</p>

              <p>Risk tolerance refers to the degree of uncertainty or variability that an investor or a company is willing to accept in their investment decisions. When considering the best, base, and worst cases in valuation, risk tolerance is a crucial factor that affects the valuation approach.

In general, the best, base, and worst cases refer to different scenarios that may occur in the future. These scenarios are typically based on different assumptions, such as different levels of economic growth, interest rates, or market conditions. The best case assumes a positive outcome, while the worst case assumes a negative outcome. The base case is typically a more realistic scenario that falls somewhere between the best and worst cases.

When valuing a company or investment in the context of best, base, and worst cases, the risk tolerance of the investor or company will affect the valuation approach. A more risk-averse investor or company may place more weight on the worst-case scenario and apply a higher discount rate to reflect the higher risk associated with that scenario. On the other hand, a more risk-tolerant investor or company may place more weight on the best-case scenario and apply a lower discount rate to reflect the potentially higher returns associated with that scenario.

In practice, the approach to valuing a company or investment in the context of best, base, and worst cases will depend on the specific circumstances of the investment and the preferences of the investor or company. A thorough analysis of the potential risks and rewards associated with each scenario is essential to arrive at a fair and accurate valuation that reflects the investor or company's risk tolerance.</p>

          <p>We generally set the investment horizon based on the Valuation Methods outcome and the Cost of Equity:<br><br>
              <strong>Low cost of equity and overvalued:</strong> This scenario is potentially risky for investors as the asset is overvalued, meaning its current market price is higher than its intrinsic value. However, the low cost of equity could provide a boost to returns in the short term, as investors may be willing to pay a premium for the asset due to low interest rates. Over the long term, the asset's overvaluation could lead to a price correction, resulting in lower returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>Low cost of equity and undervalued:</strong> This scenario presents a potentially attractive opportunity for investors. The asset is undervalued, meaning its current market price is lower than its intrinsic value, which could provide a margin of safety for investors. The low cost of equity could also help boost returns in the short term. Over the long term, as the market recognizes the asset's true value, the price could rise, resulting in higher returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>High cost of equity and overvalued:</strong> This scenario is potentially problematic for investors. The asset is overvalued, and the high cost of equity could make it difficult to justify the premium price. This could lead to a price correction in the short term, resulting in lower returns for investors.

<br><br><strong>High cost of equity and undervalued:</strong> This scenario presents a potentially attractive opportunity for investors. The asset is undervalued, meaning its current market price is lower than its intrinsic value, which could provide a margin of safety for investors. However, the high cost of equity could result in lower returns in the short term, as investors may be hesitant to pay the premium price. Over the long term, as the market recognizes the asset's true value, the price could rise, resulting in higher returns for investors.

It is important to note that these are general scenarios, and actual returns could vary depending on a variety of factors, including market conditions, industry trends, and company-specific factors. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.</p>

            <p>Our objective is to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing and managing the risk associated with your stock portfolio. In the risk allocation strategy, we have identified five types of risk to provide a comprehensive approach to portfolio management, ranging from very low to very high exposure levels. <br><br>

                1) Starting with the <strong>very low-risk</strong> category, we recommend assigning a 2% weightage to each stock. This cautious allocation ensures a minimal level of exposure to any individual stock, thereby reducing the potential impact of adverse events specific to a particular company or industry. While the returns may be relatively modest, this approach prioritizes capital preservation and stability. <br><br>

                2) For those seeking a <strong>low-risk</strong> portfolio, we suggest allocating a 4% weightage to each stock. This allocation strikes a balance between risk and potential returns, ensuring a diversified approach while allowing for a slightly broader exposure to lucrative opportunities. It provides a level of stability while still maintaining the potential for moderate growth.<br><br>
                3) Moving towards the <strong>medium-risk</strong> category, we recommend assigning a 6% weightage to each stock. This allocation reflects a moderate level of risk tolerance, allowing for a broader exposure to potentially lucrative opportunities. With a slightly higher allocation, investors can capitalize on favorable market conditions while still maintaining a diversified approach.<br><br>
                4) For investors with a <strong>high risk</strong> appetite who opt for a high-risk portfolio, we suggest assigning an 8% weightage to each stock. This aggressive allocation implies a willingness to embrace higher volatility and the potential for greater returns. It is important to note that with increased risk, the likelihood of experiencing larger fluctuations in portfolio value also rises. Therefore, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before choosing this option. <br><br>
                5) Finally, for those seeking an <strong>very high-risk</strong> portfolio, we recommend an upper bound exposure of 10% for each stock. This level of risk assumes a significant willingness to embrace volatility and the potential for substantial returns. However, it is essential to approach this category with caution, as the potential for losses is also heightened. <br><br>
                By incorporating these different risk categories into your portfolio allocation strategy, you can tailor your investment approach to your risk tolerance and financial goals, striking an appropriate balance between risk and reward.

            <p>To provide a practical example, let's consider a trader with a capital of $100,000 who expresses an interest in a very high-risk portfolio. In this scenario, we would suggest setting aside 20% of the funds as cash reserves, amounting to $20,000. This liquidity buffer ensures that you have readily available funds to seize any immediate opportunities or manage unforeseen circumstances. <br><br>

                With the remaining $80,000, we would construct a portfolio consisting of 10 stocks, carefully selected from diversified industries. This diversification helps mitigate the risk associated with any specific sector or company, enhancing the overall stability of your high-risk portfolio.<br><br>

                By following this approach, you can benefit from a well-defined risk classification framework that aligns with your risk appetite and investment objectives. Our aim is to provide a structured and tailored investment strategy that optimizes the balance between risk and potential returns, ultimately helping you achieve your financial goals.</p>

            <h2>Amassing Portfolio Strategy</h2>
            <p>In the long term, companies tend to converge towards their intrinsic value. However, it is crucial to have sufficient cash reserves to navigate short-term market fluctuations. Therefore, we employ <strong>Probability-based Technical Analysis</strong> to develop strategies that assist in generating cash flow. By leveraging this approach, we aim to optimize trading decisions and capitalize on opportunities that align with calculated probabilities. This strategy enables us to strike a balance between long-term value appreciation and the ability to withstand short-term market volatility, ultimately contributing to financial stability and growth.</p>

                A trading strategy that combines probability-based technical analysis can offer certain advantages and risks. Here are some key points to consider: <br>

                Advantages:

                <br><br><strong>Objective decision-making:</strong>Probability-based technical analysis relies on quantifiable data and statistical probabilities, which can help traders make more objective and systematic decisions. This approach reduces the influence of emotions and biases, leading to more disciplined trading.

                <br><br><strong>Risk management:</strong> By incorporating probability-based analysis, traders can focus on managing risk effectively. They can set specific entry and exit points based on calculated probabilities, helping them to generate cash in the short term.

                <br><br><strong>Backtesting and optimization:</strong> Probability-based technical analysis lends itself well to backtesting and optimization. Traders can use historical data to test the viability of their strategies, refine their parameters, and assess their potential performance before risking real capital.

                <br><br><strong>Consistency:</strong> Probability-based analysis encourages traders to follow a consistent approach based on data and probabilities. This consistency can help traders avoid impulsive or random trades, improving their overall trading performance over time.

                <br><br><strong>Using Implied Volatility instead of Historical(only for Optionable tickers):</strong>

                <br><br><strong>Forward-looking information:</strong> Implied volatility reflects the market's expectations of future price fluctuations. By incorporating implied volatility in probability-based analysis, traders can gain insights into market sentiment and expectations. This forward-looking information can be valuable for anticipating potential price movements and adjusting trading strategies accordingly.

                <br><br><strong>Real-time market perception:</strong> Implied volatility is derived from options prices, which are continually updated in real-time. By considering implied volatility, traders can gauge the market's current perception of risk and uncertainty. This information can be particularly useful during periods of high market volatility or in anticipation of significant news events.

                <br><br><strong>Flexibility across different market conditions:</strong> Implied volatility allows traders to adapt their strategies to different market conditions. By analyzing changes in implied volatility, traders can identify periods of heightened or subdued market expectations. This adaptability enables traders to adjust their trading approach, position sizing, and risk management strategies to suit the prevailing market sentiment.


                <br><br><br><br><strong>Risks:</strong>

                <br><br><strong>Imperfect predictions:</strong> While probability-based analysis provides statistical insights, it does not guarantee accurate predictions. The market can always deviate from the anticipated probabilities due to unforeseen events, changes in market sentiment, or unexpected news. Traders should be prepared for potential errors in their predictions and have contingency plans in place.

                <br><br><strong>Market expectations may be incorrect:</strong> Implied volatility is based on market participants' expectations and perceptions, which can be influenced by a range of factors. These expectations may not always accurately predict future price movements, and the market can deviate from implied volatility forecasts. Traders should be cautious of relying solely on implied volatility and consider other factors in their analysis.

                <br><br>Remember, trading involves inherent risks, and no strategy can guarantee profits. It is crucial to combine probability-based technical analysis with risk management techniques, proper position sizing, and continuous monitoring of market conditions. Additionally, consider seeking advice from financial professionals or conducting further research to refine and adapt your trading strategy.</p>
